## My process

I approached implementing this site using Javascript to toggle content visibility instead of creating a new HTML document for sub-page content. The content change controls for each page are done using the ARIA tablist. As a result, the page is screen reader-friendly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn CSS Grid and expanded my knowledge of Aria for accessibility.
